AutoRefresher
=============
AutoRefresher is a plugin for eclipse that implements automatic refreshing of file resources for
Mac OS X and Linux using system events. The plugin replaces the default filesystem polling used
by eclipse on these operating systems.

Installation
------------
Download the bundle from http://vaadin.com/addon/autorefresher and copy the contents of the
plugins directory to your eclipse/dropins/ directory.

Start eclipse and open Preferences -> General -> Workspace and check the "Refresh using native
hooks or polling" checkbox.

Enjoy!
